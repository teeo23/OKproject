# OKproject
A codecademy project on OKCupid data

I am kind of new here just trying to wrap my head around.
I have been studying python on Codecademy, and now i have
this project based on OK cupid data. i am using jupyter notebook
to work with the data. unfortunately i cannot add the main csv as
it is too big and i cannot upload it.

The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions 
and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions.


Any help is welcome
